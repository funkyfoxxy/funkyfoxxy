- 👋 Hi, I’m @funkyfoxxy
- 👀 I’m interested in learning new things and always become better at coding.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to 'master' Java. I know that the language gets joked about, but in my opinion it would be a bad idea to start learning new languages while there are still so mnuch things to learn about the one that I maybe can already use in an amateur way.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that are interesting in themselves because I learned over a period of time that projects where I can pour my heart into are the ones that drive me to learn new things and drive me to become a better coder.
- 📫 Reach me by opening an issue on one of my soon to be public repos =)
